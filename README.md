# Affinity Guard

A must-use plugin that gives git-deployed WordPress sites a security baseline. Today that means letting core install its own patches; the name leaves room for the hardening modules coming after it.

One file, no settings, no admin screen. Drop it in and forget it — it keeps itself up to date.

## Why

`WP_Automatic_Updater::is_vcs_checkout()` walks up from the install looking for `.git`, `.svn`, `.hg` or `.bzr`. One hit and WordPress refuses to run **any** background update — core, plugins, themes, translations. The reasoning is sound: core assumes a version-controlled site is deployed, and that writing files behind the deploy's back causes more trouble than it prevents.

For teams whose sites are in git for code review and rollback rather than for immutable deploys, that trade is backwards. It means hand-applying every security release across every site. Guard lifts the veto through the [`automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout/) filter and pins a conservative update policy.

## Install

```sh
cp affinity-guard.php /path/to/wp-content/mu-plugins/
```

That is the whole installation. Must-use plugins load on every request, need no activation, and cannot be switched off from the admin — which is the point on a managed fleet. WordPress only loads files at the top level of `mu-plugins`, so keep it as a single file there rather than in a subdirectory.

It works as an ordinary plugin too, if you would rather have it in `plugins/` and activate it per site.

## Defaults

| | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enabled** | `true` | The version control veto is lifted, so background updates are allowed to run |
| **Updates** | `'minor'` | Point releases (6.8.1 → 6.8.2) install themselves; major and development releases do not |
| **Self update** | `true` | Guard replaces its own file from its GitHub releases, within its current major version only |

Nothing here forces a core update. Lifting the veto only puts the site where a non-git site already is, and plugin and theme auto-updates still follow their own per-item settings.

## Overriding the defaults

Three constants, all optional, all in `wp-config.php` above the `/* That's all, stop editing! */` line:

```php
define( 'AFFINITY_GUARD_ENABLED', false );      // true (default) | false
define( 'AFFINITY_GUARD_UPDATES', 'major' );    // 'minor' (default) | 'major' | 'dev'
define( 'AFFINITY_GUARD_SELF_UPDATE', false );  // true (default) | false
```

### `AFFINITY_GUARD_ENABLED`

| Value | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `true` *(default)* | Guard applies the policy below |
| `false` | Guard registers nothing and goes inert. WordPress returns to refusing every background update on a version-controlled site, exactly as if the file were not there |

This one is constant-only, with no matching filter. It is read while the file loads, before any theme or plugin exists to filter it, so a hook would look configurable while doing nothing.

### `AFFINITY_GUARD_UPDATES`

The levels are **cumulative** — each one includes those above it. A site that wants major releases installed automatically certainly wants the security point releases too, so there is no way to ask for one branch while excluding a safer one.

| Value | Minor<br>6.8.1 → 6.8.2 | Major<br>6.8 → 6.9 | Dev<br>nightly, beta, RC |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `'minor'` *(default)* | yes | no | no |
| `'major'` | yes | yes | no |
| `'dev'` | yes | yes | yes |

The value is trimmed and lower-cased, so `' Major '` works. An unrecognised value falls back to `'minor'` and, when `WP_DEBUG` is on, raises a `_doing_it_wrong()` notice naming the typo — a misspelling should not change a site's update policy in silence.

### `AFFINITY_GUARD_SELF_UPDATE`

See [Keeping itself current](#keeping-itself-current). `false` pins the file at whatever version you deployed.

## What minor, major and dev actually mean

These are WordPress's own categories, not this plugin's. Core sorts every offered update into exactly one of them in [`Core_Upgrader::should_update_to_version()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/core_upgrader/should_update_to_version/) (`wp-admin/includes/class-core-upgrader.php`) and asks a different filter about each.

### Minor — [`allow_minor_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_minor_auto_core_updates/)

**6.8.1 → 6.8.2.** An update within the same `x.y` branch, where only the third number moves. Core detects it by comparing the first two version segments: same branch, minor update.

These are maintenance and security releases. They carry bug fixes and security patches, add no features, and are the releases WordPress installs by itself on a normal site. This is the level the plugin defaults to, and the reason it exists — an unattended security patch is the update you least want to be applying by hand across a fleet.

### Major — [`allow_major_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_major_auto_core_updates/)

**6.8 → 6.9.** An update that moves to a higher `x.y` branch.

Worth knowing that this is not semver, and the naming trips people up: WordPress calls 6.8 → 6.9 a *major* release even though only the second number changes, and 7.0 is not special — it is the release after 6.9, nothing more. Major releases are the feature releases. They ship new blocks, editor changes and API deprecations, and they are where something in a theme or plugin can break. Off by default here for that reason.

### Dev — [`allow_dev_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_dev_auto_core_updates/)

**6.9-beta1 → 6.9-beta2, or 7.0-alpha-59321 → 7.0-alpha-59400.** Nightlies, alphas, betas and release candidates.

Core decides this from the version the site is *already running*: a `$wp_version` containing a hyphen is a development version. Two consequences worth being clear about:

- **`'dev'` will not move a stable site onto a beta.** A site on 6.8 is not a development version, so this filter is never consulted there. The level only governs sites already on the nightly, beta or RC channel — a dedicated test install, not production.
- **On a development install, dev is a gate rather than a branch.** Core checks it first and blocks everything if it fails, then *falls through* to the minor or major question for the target version. So a site on 6.9-beta1 set to `'minor'` would have every update refused at the dev gate, including the beta2 that fixes something. That fall-through is exactly why the levels here are cumulative: `'dev'` opens the gate and permits what lies beyond it.

### Which filters this drives

| Behaviour | Filter |
| --- | --- |
| Treat the install as not version-controlled | [`automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout/) |
| Minor core releases | [`allow_minor_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_minor_auto_core_updates/) |
| Major core releases | [`allow_major_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_major_auto_core_updates/) |
| Development releases | [`allow_dev_auto_core_updates`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/allow_dev_auto_core_updates/) |

All four are added at priority 100: late enough to beat a theme or plugin setting a blanket policy on the default priority, early enough that your own code can still override it.

## Keeping itself current

WordPress has no update path for must-use plugins — they are not in `get_plugins()`, so nothing in core ever offers them a new version. Guard therefore checks [its own releases](https://github.com/affinitybridge/affinity-guard/releases) on a daily cron and replaces its own file, which is how a fleet picks up new hardening features without a deploy.

Self-modifying code deserves scrutiny, so here is exactly what it will and will not do.

**It refuses to install anything unless all of these hold:**

| Check | Why |
| --- | --- |
| The release tag is a semantic version | A tag like `nightly` is not something to install |
| The version is higher than the running one | No downgrades, no reinstalls |
| The major version matches | 1.x never becomes 2.x on its own — see [Versioning](#versioning) |
| The file starts with `<?php` and identifies as Affinity Guard | Wrong file, wrong repository |
| Its header version matches the release | Catches a mistagged release |
| The whole file parses as PHP | The realistic failure is a truncated download, and this file runs on **every** request — an unparseable one is a site down, not a feature missing |

**How it writes:** to a temporary file first, then `rename()` into place, which is atomic on a local filesystem — a request arriving mid-update sees the whole old file or the whole new one, never half of each. The previous version is kept beside it as `affinity-guard.php.bak` (`.bak`, not `.php`, so WordPress does not load it as a second must-use plugin). Restoring is a `mv` away. Any failure leaves the running version untouched.

**It stands down** when `AFFINITY_GUARD_SELF_UPDATE` is `false`, when `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` is set — a site that has declared its files off limits has said so about this file too — or when the file is not writable.

## Extending it

Guard loads before any ordinary plugin, so it is a reasonable place to hang other security tooling. These hooks are the supported surface, stable for the life of the 1.x line:

| Hook | Type | Signature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `affinity_guard_loaded` | action | `( string $version )` — everything is registered and overridable |
| `affinity_guard_update_level` | filter | `( string $level )` — return `'minor'`, `'major'` or `'dev'`; anything else is ignored |
| `affinity_guard_self_update_enabled` | filter | `( bool $enabled )` — veto self updating at runtime |
| `affinity_guard_self_updated` | action | `( string $from, string $to )` — the new file is on disk, this request still runs the old code |
| `affinity_guard_self_update_failed` | action | `( string $reason, string $version )` — nothing changed; wire this to your monitoring |

```php
add_action( 'affinity_guard_self_update_failed', function ( $reason, $version ) {
	error_log( "Affinity Guard $version could not update itself: $reason" );
}, 10, 2 );
```

## Versioning

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), where the public API is the three `AFFINITY_GUARD_*` constants and the hooks above.

| Change | Bump |
| --- | --- |
| A constant or hook is renamed, removed, or changes meaning | **Major** |
| A new module, constant or hook is added, defaults unchanged | **Minor** |
| A fix that changes no documented behaviour | **Patch** |

Self updates never cross a major boundary, so anything that could break your sites waits for a deploy you make deliberately. Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## What still overrides all of this

`AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED` and `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` stop the updater before these filters are ever reached, and `DISABLE_WP_CRON` means nothing runs unless a real cron job calls `wp-cron.php` — including Guard's own update check. Check all three first when a site never updates.

## The deploy question

Background updates write to `wp-admin`, `wp-includes` and the updated plugin or theme directory, and Guard's self update writes to `affinity-guard.php`. On a site whose `mu-plugins` directory is tracked, that shows up as working-tree changes on the server. Decide which of these you are before rolling it out:

- **Deploy is a `git pull` on the server.** Updates apply and work. Commit the resulting changes, or your next deploy reverts them.
- **Deploy builds from a clean checkout elsewhere.** The update is real until the next release overwrites it. Pin versions in the repository instead, set `AFFINITY_GUARD_SELF_UPDATE` to `false`, and treat Guard as a deployed dependency.
